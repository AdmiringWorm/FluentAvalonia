  "AppWindowDesc1": "A special window style designed to mock the modern UWP/WinUI style window. The window has been made so the resize handles work outside the window, like normal, so they don't overlap with your content. And the titlebar retains its height when the window is Maximized.",
  "AppWindowDesc2": "On Windows 11, the snap layout flyout still works!",

  "AppWindowTitleBarDesc2": "If you want to use your own titlebar, use the ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar property. AppWindowTitleBar provides easy ways for you to customize the window drag regions with custom titlebar too (see below)",
  "AppWindowSplashScreenDesc": "AppWindow supports a modern style splashscreen which allows you to intialize your app before the content loads",
  "PlatformFeaturesDesc1": "AppWindow also enables a couple more features",
